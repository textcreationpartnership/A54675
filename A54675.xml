            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An APPENDIX To the AGREEMENT for the PEOPLE</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I come to ſpeak to the other Paper. I ſhall anſwer for my owne. Whereas ſome may be apt to object againſt it as needleſſe, thus</p>
            <p n="1">1. Maſter <hi>Aſhurſt</hi> a Parliament man of knowne integrity, and of eminent repute for Piety, in his Reaſons againſt agreement with a Paper intituled <hi>The Agreement of the Peopl</hi> hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently done this work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is likely that many of thoſe who have ſtuck to the Parliament, will be forward of themſelves to reject the new Module, when they ſee it comming from thoſe heads and hands, by which ſo many Members of Parliament have been violently detained from the exerciſe of that truſt wherein they have been eminently active for the Peoples freedome.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is not imaginable that the buſineſſe will proceed to ſubſcription, ſeeing it is inconſiſtent with the Declaration of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, ſet up by their Command in the Pariſh meeting-places.</p>
            <p>To the firſt Objection I anſwer, That though Maſter <hi>Aſhurſt</hi> hath handled the ſubject both as a Chriſtian, and as a States-man, with invincible Reaſons; Yet ſeeing that Price is not ſo common as it deſerves to be, it may be the Lot of this paper to come to ſuch hands as miſſe of that, and ſo this may do ſome good, though not ſo much as the other</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56025:3"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 15 -->
            <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, that the new Module comming from men who have done much good ſervice in another kind; and being penned with ſo much artifice, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſome men of honeſt affections may be ſurprized into a ſubſcription, if they be not forewarned of the danger; for their ſakes therefore have I undertaken this.</p>
            <p>To the third I anſwer, the provocations of this back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Kingdome are ſo great, that we know not how farre Providence may (in Gods juſt judgement,) permit things to be ſwayed contrary to our apprehenſions, as we have ſeen by late and unexpected experience; it will therefore be wiſedome to feare the worſt, and provide a timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which I deſire to do in few words; not medling with thoſe circumſtances which make the new Module practicable, nor many things which are materiall in it; my purpoſe not being to give an ample anſwer, but to put in a ſufficient caution againſt it; by ſhewing that the main things in it, and thoſe that ſeem to be moſt intended by it, are ſuch as (ſo farre as I can ſee, having compared them with the Law and the Teſtimony,) cannot be ſubſcribed unto by moſt of the Parliaments Partakers without Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nor by any ſubject of this Kingdome without ſinne. The things moſt conſiderable in that agreement are two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The alteration of the Civill Government from King, Lords and Commons in Parliament aſſembled, to new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentees in ſtead of a Parliament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The vaſt Toleration of hereſie, ſchiſm, idolatry, and other ſins immediately againſt the God of glory. Upon theſe two branches <hi>I</hi> ſhall proceed.</p>
            <p>That the new Module cannot be ſubſcribed by moſt of the Parliaments friends without Perjury, I argue thus. For any men to ſubſcribe to things contrary to their owne Oaths, is perjury; but moſt of all the Parliaments friends have taken the ſolemne League and Covenant, wherein they have ſworne conſtantly to indeavour to bring the Churches of God in the three Kingdomes to the neareſt uniformity in Religion and Forme of Church-Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to indeavour the extirpation of ſuperſtition, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56025:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 15 -->ſchiſme, and to preſerve the Rights and Priviledges of the Parliament, and the Kings Majeſties Authority, that the world may beare witneſſe with their conſciences of their loyalty, and that they have no thoughts or intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to diminiſh his Majeſties juſt Power, and that they ſhall with all faithfulneſſe, endeavour the diſcovery of all ſuch as ſhall be evill inſtruments, by hindering the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion, dividing the King from his people, or one Kingdome from another, that they may be brought to condigne puniſhment: therefore it is perjury for moſt of the Parliaments friends to ſubſcribe to the new Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which gives Toleration to ſuperſtition, hereſie and ſchiſme, and which takes away Rights and Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Parliament, and the Kings Authority, and divides the King from his people, and obſtructs uniformity in Religion and Forme of Church-Government, and is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to divide this Kingdome from one or both of the other. The Oath of Allegiance and the Proteſtation which many of them alſo have taken, obliges them expreſſely to ſome of the forementioned particulars, which are contrary to the new Agreement. Let me therefore beſeech all thoſe which have taken either the Oath of Allegiance, or the Proteſtation, or the Covenant in the feare of God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe texts of Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.1, 4. <hi>Lord, who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill? he that ſweareth to his owne hurt and changeth not,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.2. <hi>I counſell thee to keep the Kings Commandement, and that in regard of the Oath of God,</hi> Ezek. 17.19. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, as I live, ſurely mine Oath that he hath deſpiſed and the Covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompence upon his owne head.</hi> This I hope will be ſufficient to make every one that fears an Oath, to take heed how he give it under his hand, that he is reſolved to breake his Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now in the next place I ſhall hold forth unto you that the new Agreement cannot be ſubſcribed by any Subject of this Kingdome without finne; in regard of the two chief branches above mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The alteration of the Civill Governement, and the Toleration about matters of Religion.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56025:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <!-- PDF PAGE 16 -->
            <p>Concerning the Civil part of the Agreement, I argue thus; It is ſinfull in any ſubject to ſubſcribe to that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the duty of a ſubject; but to alter the ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a State, is contrary to the duty of a Subject; therefore it is finfull in any Subiect to ſubſcribe to alter the Supreme Government. That it is contrary to the duty of a Subiect to go about to alter the Supreme Government of a Kingdome wherein he is a Subject, is evident in many Scriptures, whereof I ſhall here produce a few, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.21, 22. <hi>Feare thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change, for their calamity ſhall riſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi> Rom. 13.1, 2. <hi>Let every ſoule be ſubiect unto the Higher-powers, for there is no power but of God, the Powers that be are of God; whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and they thas reſiſt receive to themſelves damnation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13. <hi>Submit your ſelves unto every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake; whether it be to the King as ſupreme, or unto Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as unto them that are ſent by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the other branch in the Agreement about Religion; wherein there is protection made for idolatry, hereſie, and other the like abominations, I argue thus; That whereby Proviſion is made to protect idolatry, hereſie, or any the like abominations is ſinfull; but by ſubſcribing to the new Agreement about Religion, Proviſion is made to protect idolatry, hereſie, and the like abominations: therefore ſubſcribing to the new Agreement about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is ſinfull. That to make Proviſion to protect idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, hereſie, or any the like abomination, is ſinfull, the Scripture abundantly ſhews; yet <hi>I</hi> ſhall now produce onely two or three witneſſes, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.2, 3. <hi>it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they ſhall no more be remembred: and alſo</hi> I <hi>will cauſe the Prophets and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane Spirit to paſſe out of the land; and it ſhall come to paſſe that when any ſhall yet propheſie, then his father and mother that begat-him, ſhall ſay unto him, thou ſhalt not live, for thou propheſieſt lyes in the name of the Lord, and his father and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56025:5"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 17 -->his mother that beg at him, ſhall thruſt him through when he propheſieth,</hi> Tit. 1.10, 11. <hi>there are many deceivers, whoſe mouths muſt be ſtopt, who ſubvert whole houſes, teaching things which they ought not,</hi> Rev. 2.20. I <hi>have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt that woman</hi> Iezebel, <hi>which calleth her ſelf a Propheteſſe, to teach and to ſeduce my ſervants, to eate things ſacrificed to idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewed you my grounds againſt ſubſcribing this new Agreement; I ſhall proceed to anſwer an Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Querie, and remove a double temptation.</p>
            <p>The Obiection which a democraticall ſpirit is apt to forge, runs thus. If that Oath which we have taken, for the maintaining of the Parliaments Priviledges, and the King. Authority be to maintaine an uſurped power, and if we be perſwaded that the ſupreme power is ſeated in our ſelves, what hurt would it be to lay aſide our Covenant?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, though this ſuppoſition be made up of fancy, rather then reality: yet if there were as much truth in the ſuppoſition, as there is confidence in ſome men about it: yet by no means may ſuch an Oath or Covenant be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; though in humane probability, the flouriſhing or freedome of a Kingdome might be attained thereby; and for this caſe I ſhall give you a parallel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>the King of</hi> Babylon <hi>is come to Jeruſalem, and hath taken the King thereof, and the Princes thereof, and hath led them with him to</hi> Babylon, <hi>and hath taken of the Kings ſeed and made a Covenant with him, and hath taken an Oath of him, he hath alſo taken the mighty of the land, that the Kingdome might be baſe, that it might not lift up it ſelf, but that by keeping of his Covenant it might ſtand; but he rebelled againſt him in ſending his Embaſſadours into</hi> Egypt, <hi>that they might give him horſes and much People: ſhall he proſper, ſhall he eſcape that deth ſuch things? or ſhall he breake the Covenant and be delivered?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The temptation to ſubſcription, from this conſideration, that this new Module is commended to the People from an armed hand, though not in an armed way; may be a ſnare two ways. 1. By way of humane confidence. 2. By way of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane feare. 1. Some who otherwiſe would not be induced to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56025:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 18 -->ſubſcribe, may be allured by thinking that if they do ſubſcribe they ſhall have the more ſpeciall protection from the Army: 2. Some who otherwiſe could not be perſwaded to ſubſcribe, may be wrought upon by fancying, that if they do not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, they may be liable to the diſpleaſure of thoſe, who have power to do them an ill turne. Theſe humane temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be anſwered by humane conſiderations; but I wave them; having ſome pieces of armour of proof, <hi>and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons that are not carnall, but mighty through God;</hi> which I ſhall commend to every poore ſoule, that may be aſſaulted with either of the forementioned temptations.</p>
            <p>And firſt to that temptation of humane confidence, I ſhall returne theſe Scripture meditations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.3. <hi>Now the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are men and not God, and their horſes fleſh and not ſpirit; when the Lord ſhall ſtretch out his hand, both be that helpeth ſhall fall, and he that is holpen ſhall fall down, and they all ſhall fall together,</hi> Ezek. 17.17, 18. <hi>neither ſhall</hi> Pharaoh <hi>with his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Army, and great company make for him in the warre, by caſting up mounts and building up forts to cut off many Perſons, Seeing he deſpiſed the Oath by breaking the Covenant, (when lo he had given his hand,) and hath done all theſe things, he ſhall not eſcape.</hi>

            <p>To that other temptation of humane feare, I ſhall returne theſe Scripture conſiderations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13. <hi>I even I am he that comforteth you; who art thou that thou ſhouldſt be afraid of a man that ſhall die, and of the Son of man that ſhall be made as graſſe? and forgetteth the Lord thy Maker, that hath ſtretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and haſt feared continually every day becauſe of the fury of the Oppreſſour, as if he were ready to deſtroy, and where is he fury of the Oppreſſour?</hi> Heb. 1.3.5, 6. <hi>he hath ſaid</hi> I <hi>will never leave thee nor forſake thee, ſo that we may boldly ſay the Lord is my helper, and</hi> I <hi>will not feare what man can do unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, if by what thou haſt read, thou haſt gained any Reſolution, I have my aim; however I have diſcharged my conſcience.</p>
